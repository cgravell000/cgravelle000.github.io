<h2>Basic Facts: </h2>
<p class = paragraph>Hi! My name is Charlie Gravelle, I'm 19 years old, and I go to the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
At UW-Madison I am studying mechanical engineering and I am apart of the University-Band and the Wisconsin Racing engineering team.
Last summer I had an internship with a construction company called Mortenson, and next semester I am going to intern at Tesla in Austin TX.
I enjoyed the constrcution industry, but I look forward to trying the design industry at Tesla. I first became interested in engineering
in elementary school with Legos. In high school I was on a team that built a motorcycle from scratch and that's when I knew I wanted
to do engineering in college. Apart from engineering, my interests are listed below!
